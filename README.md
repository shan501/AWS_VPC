# AWS_VPC

##Create a vpc in AWS using python and add a subnet and vpn connection to it.

In this python script it will create a vpc , attach a subnet and vpn connection to it.VPC provides logically isolated sections of a network.
It closely resembles the type of network you would have on-premise but with the benefit of running it in the cloud.

##To Start
To start you would need to create a user in AWS. Allow for programmatic access.Then set the access you want for that user 
Aws will then provide you with a access and private key.Save both for use later. 

run this command and put in the access and private key 

```
aws configure 

```
now you would just need to install boto3 and aws cli

```
pip3 install boto3 
pip3 install awscli

``` 

Now you can start coding
